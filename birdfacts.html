  <p>Crows, and other Corvids, hold funerals! But not for the same reason, they do so to assess whether they are in danger or not! Also a group of Crows is called a murder!</p>

        <p>The Keas of New Zealand's South Island are incredibly smart! The same as Corvids, they have been seen solving logic puzzles, doing things in a specific order to recieve food, and even constructing and using tools! However, where corvids are more akin to the mafia of the bird world, Keas are just around to hang out cause chaos. </p>

        <p>Pidgeons and Crows are both capable of remembering human faces! Pidgeons will tend to avoid those that threaten or scare them, and will be more confident around those that feed them! Crows meanwhile will sometimes give those that feed them "gifts"! So go befrind a murder of crows today*!</p>

        <p>Many birds, especially the migratory ones, are capable of sleeping while flying! Many of these birds are able to "lock" their wings while outstretched allowing them to continue soaring without expending energy!</p>

    <p>*Befriending a murder of crows is probably not the best idea. You probably shouldn't do that, but I'm not in charge of you, go live your life how you want!</p>
