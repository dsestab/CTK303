        <h3>Interesting Information on Beyonce's Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    We all know Beyonce's massive impact on the music industry, and how popular her and her songs are. However, many people may not really consider the massive positive impact she has on the US economy. Economic Analysts believe that Beyonce's "Renaissance" Tour, and Taylor Swift's "Eras" Tour could generate, according to <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/11/business/beyonce-taylor-swift-tour-spending.html target="_blank"><i>The New York Times</i></a>, "$4.5 billion in spending" with the "Eras" tour potentially generating 4.6 billion in spending.
