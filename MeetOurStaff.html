      <h2>Mason Miller, CEO</h2>
      <p>Joining the Avian Information Haven in 2001, Mason fit well with the Haven's staff and quickly became an important member of our organization. They took over the role of CEO in 2021 after Ms. Ockland decided to go into a "soft retirement" as she called it. Mason is now the main face of the organizaiton, and takes great pride in keeping our organization running and operating smoothly. Ms Ockland, when announcing Mr. Mason's appointment as CEO, said "I know that if Ethan was with us today, he would be incredibly happy and proud to have such a talented and capable young person helping us run this organization. This organizaiton was his brain child, and I know that he would be able to rest easy knowing it is now in your hands."</p>
      <p>Growing up in Lincoln, Nebraska, Mason became fascinated by birds at an extremely young age. They followed bird migration patterns and would spend hours staring into the sky each day to watch the birds fly past. They attended Purdue University, from which they graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor's Degree in Ornithology and Buisness Management. They recently recieved their Master's Degree in Ornithology from Purdue University in 2017, following lots of encouragement from friends and family. Mason is excited to announce that they are currently pursuing a Doctorate in Ornithology, also at Purdue, that they hope to complete by May of 2025!</p>
      <p>During their free time, when not bird watching, they love to read, draw, and spend time with their cat Pringles, and their partner Micah.</p>

      <h2>Claire Fry, Archive Manager</h2>
      <p>Joining the Avian Information Haven in 2007, Claire has spearheaded our digitizing efforts. For the first year of our digitizing process, she selflessly took on the Herculean task by herself. She was joined by programmers Conrad Wrent and Jay Tinsly in 2008, and the trio immediately set about building up our website. Claire herself is responsible for the maintaining and fostering of our servers. All of our new information passes by Claire and her team, who make sure all information is factual by checking sources, before adding the information to our Archives to make sure what we store is the most up-to-date information possible.</p>
      <p>Having grown up in Melbourne, Australia, Claire quickly became fascinated with the more "exotic" kinds of birds, like the native Emus. She has since doubled as the head researcher into Emus, Cassowaries, and Ostriches.</p>
      <p>The organization as a whole would also like to extend a heartfelt thanks to Claire's wife, Fiona, who kept a lot of the Haven sane with her baking while we have been rebuilding our servers.</p>

        <h2>Anthony Newman, PR Chief</h2>
        <p>Our newest addition to the Haven family, joining us in 2018, Anthony has taken charge of the Avian Information Haven's social accounts. He has gone about making our public image more well known, helping us make deals with other organizations to help the Haven stay financially positive, and to help other organizations with their efforts as well. Anthony has recently been key in the deal we announced earlier this year announcing our partnership with World Wildlife Fund.</p>
        <p>Anthony joins the Haven after growing up in Newfoundland, Canada. It was on his home island that he started observing Puffins, Shrikes, and other coastal species. This rough and rainy terrain made reloacation to Alaska easy for him, and he has taken to our organizaiton amazingly.</p>
        <p>Anthony has worked for organizations like "The New York Times", "CNN", and "Polygon", writing articles and attending press events. With this experience working in extremely competitive and fast paced environments, Anthony has helped keep the Haven up-to-date on the latest innovations in advertising, allowing our presence to become more well known</p>

        <h2>Zoe David, Head of Outreach</h2>
        <p>Joining the Haven in 1999, Zoe has worked to expand our services to many charitable organizaitons across the world. Zoe has helped the Haven offer services to organizaitons like the World Wildlife Fund to allow them to more safely relocate and aid avians across their operations. Zoe also helped found our youth outreach program in Alaska and Canada, Hatchling Recue.</p>
        <p>Before joining us, Zoe served in the United States National Guard, aiding in extinguishing forest fires. After losing her leg due to an illness, she was Honorably Dishcharged and got in touch with Ms Ockland about helping the Haven. Ms Ockland welcomed Zoe into the family, and Zoe immediately started working on finding a way to provide the various United States programs designed to fight forest fires with the resources and information required to save as many birds as possible from the burning forests.</p>

        <h2>Sage Robertson, Conservation Representative</h2>
        <p>Sage Robertson joined the Haven in 2012. Following their joining, they started working with Zoe David with Outreach. Over time, Sage proved to be too personable to be sitting at our HQ. And so, in 2014, Sage was appointed as our Conservation Representative. Anytime the Haven has been invited to an event, to speak or just to attend, Sage has attended for the Haven, occasionally joined by other members.</p>
        <p>Sage grew up in New York City, New York, and has stated many times that moving to Alaska was a massive culture shock for them. Sage wanted it to be noted that "they did not expect to be so invested in the safety and preservation of Avian lives and knowledge, when they grew up with pidgeons harrassing them every day."</p>
