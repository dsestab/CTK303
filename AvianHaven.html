      <h2>What is Ornithology</h2>
        <p>Ornithology is the study of birds. Ornithologists research various topics like evolution, anatomy, and ecology, while also planning out conservation and wildlife management. The Smithsonian Division of Birds states that "Birds are distinguished from other living vertebrates by three things: feathers, hollow bones, and hard shelled eggs."</p>
        
        <p>Humans have been studying birds in some form for an extremely long time. Cave paintings of birds from prehistory have been discovered, showing an observational interest in birds from humans. Aristotle even made sudies of birds in 350 BC. He noted habits of migration, egg laying, moulting, and lifespans, as well as identifying 170 different bird species. Modern scientific ornithology is considered to begin in 1676 with the writing of "Ornithologiae libri tres" by Francis Willughby and John Ray.</p>

      <h2>The Haven's Past and Future</h2>
        <p>The Avian Information Haven was founded in 1979 by Peany C. Ockland and Ethan A. Gleeson in Juneau, Alaska. The pair initially set out with the objective of compiling encyclopedias of information on as many bird species as possible. The Haven released the 1st edition of "The Tribute to Birds" on March 19, 1981. Following the success of the first edition, the pair started expanding the Haven to many other markets like conservation and wildlife rescue, providing many organizations with information vital in ensuring birds in danger are able to be safely moved to a new home.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Ethan passed away at the age of 32 in 1993. Following his passing, Ockland started hiring staff to assist her in the day to day running of the Haven. After the explosion of the internet, the objective of The Haven shifted back to its initial purpose of preserving information. The Haven started digitizing the information found in its encyclopedias in 2007. After a server crash that caused the old site to go down, The Avian Information Haven has set about rebuilding our digital presence, information will be updated as we recover more data. Eventually the Haven will have information on the majority of the worlds known avian species. </p>
